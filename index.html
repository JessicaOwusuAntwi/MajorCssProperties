        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used for website layout in
        design and used alongside HTML. CSS is a styling language.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are <b>three</b> types or methods of CSS. There's
        <b>In-line Css</b>,<b>Internal Css</b>and<b>External Css.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In-line CSS</b>is added in the opening tag of an<b>HTML</b>element as
        a <i>style attribute</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Internal CSS</b> is added to your html file using a
        <i>style tag</i> in the head element just after the title tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>External CSS</b> is a little different. It is an external Css file
        that is linked to your html file. The link is added in the head of an
        html file.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also <b>Css Selectors</b> used to select html elements you
        want to style. We have <b>element selectors</b>, <b>class selectors</b>,
        <b>id selectors</b>, just to name a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        There also is
        <b
          >Css specificity, cascade hierachy and inheritance. These concepts
          control what Css applies to what element</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, i learnt about the <b>CSS Box model</b>and how to set
        <i>borders, margins and paddings.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least, i learnt about major CSS properties like
        <i
          >comments, colors, background, outline, text-decorator,
          text-transform</i
        >
        and a whole lot of awesome stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is <i>very</i> <b>important </b> because it gives style to your html
        and makes it attractive to view.

        <b>Padding</b>is used to create space around an element's content,
        inside of any defined borders. It can accept up to<i>four</i>values for
        <b>top, right, bottom</b> and <b>left</b> paddings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Margins</b>are used to create space around elements, outside of any
        defined borders.It can also accept up to <i>four</i> values for<b
          >top, right, bottom</b
        >and<b>left</b>margins.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Border</b>allows you to specify the style, width, and color of an
        element's border.There is border width, border color and border style.
